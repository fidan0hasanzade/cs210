My plan for this project is to compare the hours I spend on youtube uring exam times vs outside the exam times. I aim to analyze and see whether there is a correlation and how strong it is if present. This can help me understand the affect of watching youtube during the exam days on my academic performance.Perhaps the findings can benefit other students as well and can make us all reflect. I plan to use youtube aim api and other tools to acess the data. after data is accessed it will be filtered and clensed of all the irrelevant information. The gathered information will be coded and categorised. All information that is too personal and not relevant will be in a coded form. After analyzing the data it during exam and non exam times it will be plotted onto graphs or tables to visually demonstrate it for easy comprehention. Finally I hope the data will be acted upon and benefited from, leading to higher grade during on the exams.
